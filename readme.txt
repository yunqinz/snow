	Use a graphic editor to build at least two sprites: a sprite for background and a sprite that will bounce around in your display window.All of the constants in program can be read from an XML file.So modify or add data to the XML file used in the basic framework code to meet the requirement.Use the basic framework code,and reuse the Frame that contains the SDL_Surface for class ‘sprite’.Use an STL container (either an std::vector or std::list), to hold lots of sprites flying around your background.The basic framework incorporate the sprites that used into the animation. The animation can be modified by changing the XML file that holds the constants and sprite information in the game;this file is called game.xml in directory xmlSpec.By changing the values in game.xml,many features of the animation can be changed,like the number of sprites that are bouncing around on canvas.The Specs that I implemented are:1.Use graphic editor ’inkscape’ draws one picture called ‘snow.bmp’ bounce around the canvas, and modifies a picture called ‘winter.bmp’ used as background.
2.The animation can be changed through changing the constants in file game.xml’.
3.Modify class ‘Manager’ so that it animates many sprites, instead of just one sprite. Use std::vector to contain the sprites.
4.Modify class ‘IOManager’ and ‘Gamedata’ so that they use the Meyers approach.5.Modify class Clock so that it caps the frame rate at 60 fps.
6.Valgrind reveals no memory leaks in user code.
7.Modify IOManager so that printMessageValueAt uses the intrinsic model.The Specs that I was unable to implement are: 
Print the ticks on screen.Extras: NO
